# breaking_bad_app
A simple app for displaying characters of the series with 
some details on each character.

In this app I worked on implementing the following skills:
- Api calls and organizing data on the UI.
- Utilizing the BLoc/Cubit Pattern.
- Creating a functional search in the app.
- Using clean animations in page transitions.
